# Ethminer_Watchdog
Restarts Ethminer on Error in Logfile

__________________________________________________________________________________________

Copy all Files into Ethminer Folder.

Configure mining.cmd, watchdog.bat to your needs ( or just mine to my address :P )

start watchdog.bat

keypress in mining process:

"X": restarts on current pool, creates a new DAG

"R": restarts Batchfile, you can choose a new pool.


Tipps: set -v 1 to get smallest output ( speed is not shown in this minimalistic output, but corretly transfered to pool )

If you donÂ´t like to download unknown executables (wintee),
